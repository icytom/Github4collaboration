# Github for Collaboration
 How to work with Github in groups.

## Log into GitHub desktop

* Create an account if you haven't got one.
* Download GitHub desktop if you are using your own machine.
* Open GitHub desktop and login.

## Create a new repository

* On GitHub desktop or on GitHub.com one person in the group create a new repository and name it.

## Give someone else access to your repository

* Ask them for their username.
* On GitHub.com go to **Settings -> Manage access**
* Press **Invite a collaborator** 
* Add the username of the person you want to collaborate with and press the add button
* The collaborator now needs to accept the invitation send to them by email

## How to clone a repository

* Now that everyone can access the repository you can all clone it
* The easiest way to do this is to press **Clone or Download** on the repositories page on github.com and press open in desktop
* GitHub desktop will now open, once you have checked the location is ok, press clone.

## Working with files

* Before you add new content remember to first **FETCH** to check that someone else hasn't made changes to the repository and **PULL** and changes
* When you have added new content **COMMIT** and **PUSH** the changes to the repository 

## Conflict

* If the same line in a file is edited by multiple team members at the same time the edits may conflict when the files are pushed back into the repository.
* If this happens you will need to resolve the conflict, this video may help:
